How do we install Falco? Expectation: a procedural document giving all the steps in order to have it running, does falco require multiple instances? One instance is sufficient to inspect all things we want?


Falco is installed using a DaemonSet on kubernetes, Therefore we follow the documentation on downloading and installing Falco and integrating it into Kubernetes here:
https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/third-party/learning/

Upon installing this, inspecting using kubectl get pods, there are six pods that are created, but the status is set to CrashLoopBackOff.

How do monitor Falco actions? Expectation: a reference/commands on how to get Falco metrics/logs
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
What is Falco's scope of inspection? Expectation: Describe on how we can have Falco monitoring one container, multiple containers, one deployment, all deployments based on a rule, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------



How can we test that Falco is doing what we expect from it? Expectation: A small demo on how we can do malicious actions on a workload and see Falco reacting and alerting us about it
( Example: let's try and do a simulated unauthorized action, how will Falco react? will we be notified about it?)
